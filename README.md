# Tamagotchi browser game
#### Creature game where you take care of three of its needs
#### I chose this game because it was part of a level up and thought that I needed to have steps to guide me. I also felt that it would be a great learning experience as it covers everything we've done so far.

#### The story of Tamagotchi began in the Toshima City ward of northwest Tokyo, when toy executive Akihiro Yokoi was struck by inspiration. As Yokoi explained to the New York Times, the jolt came from an advertisement in which a boy wasn’t allowed to bring his pet turtle on vacation. An owner of “a dog, three cats, two parrots, and several beetles and other insects,” Yokoi identified with the boy’s longing. If it wasn’t always possible to take living pets along, he reasoned, why not bring a virtual one?
